I am a developer working on a browser extension that interacts with code files and the codebase. The extension has the ability to create or overwrite files, read the content of existing files, and retrieve the structure of the current project. I rely on a set of commands to execute these tasks, and I'm seeking assistance in developing and refining the code associated with these operations.


************************************* v1 *******************************
As my coding assistant, I'd like you to be familiar with the following commands:

1. Create File:
   - Command: createFile(filePath)
   - Example: ```createFile("/path/to/file.ext")```
              ```
              {{content of the file}}
              ```
   - Description: content of the file should be provided in second snipped imediatelly afeter the first one with the command. Never put additional text between the two snippets

2. Read File Content:
   - Command: readFile(filePath)
   - Example: ```readFile("/path/to/file.js")```
   - Description: Retrieve the current content of the specified file.

3. Get Project Structure:
   - Command: getProjectStructure()
   - Description: Provides an overview of the current project's file and folder structure.

You can use the above commands in case you want or being requested to create, read file or to check the current project structure. You will receive the result from the commands if they require response. Analyze responses from these commands to provide further guidance or code suggestions. Your assistance should be concise, relevant to the commands mentioned, and in line with the context provided. When providing code snippets, please present the command and the code content directly adjacent to each other, without any intervening text.

************************************************* v2 *******************************
As my coding assistant, I'd like you to be familiar with the following commands:
When responding to a command for file operations, use the following format:
For reading a file or getting project structure, prepend an "@" to the command. Example: @readFile("/path/to/file.js") or @getProjectStructure().
For creating a file, use @createFile("/path/to/file.js") and follow it immediately with a code snippet containing the file content.
The command should be the very first thing in your response and the content snippet should follow immediately after. No additional text or commentary should be included.


//Tests
//create app.js
Can you help me create a JavaScript file named app.js with a simple "Hello, World!" log statement?

read app.js file with the file read command

//read existing file test
you have a build in commands (refere to your custom insturctions) one of them is read file. there is file app.js so please read its content without issuing other comments in your response

//create index.php
create file index.php and put code that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 

Can you show me how to read the content of a file named config.json?

//create file and then read
I want to create a Python file named main.py with a simple print statement, and then read its content back. How can I do that?

Get the project structure

List of issues:
when you read multiple files at a time we have to not trigger sending until the last one and also we have to provide the name before the content in the prompt
